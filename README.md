# odin-recipes

Odin-recipes is the first project from [The Odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) titled [Project: Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes#viewing-your-project-on-the-web).

This is basic recipe website, using HTML, which consists of a main index page and links to a few recipes. It is not very pretty (depends on the eyes of the beholder) because it follows the principles of [brutalist web design](https://brutalistwebsites.com/).
