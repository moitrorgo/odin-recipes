    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Bulgogi, or Korean beef barbecue, is undoubtedly one of the most quintessentially Korean dishes there are: gorgeously <strong>thin slices of ribeye, tenderloin, or sirloin marinated in a savory-sweet sauce</strong> and quickly cooked over flame. Bul, meaning "fire," and <em>gogi</em>, meaning "meat," originated in Korea's Goguryeo era (the 1st century BCE to the 7th century CE), and once you taste these <strong>perfectly caramelized morsels of sweet and savory meat</strong>, you'll understand why this dish has stood the test of time.
      The tables at Korean restaurants even feature built-in charcoal or gas grills for guests to enjoy this iconic communal dining experience, combining meat and fire served with rice, lettuce leaves, and sumptuous sides (more on that below) in handmade bites, personalized to delight your own unique taste buds.
